# Meta argument - 
we have so far created one resource but we want to create many resource of same type, so META_ARGUMENT is used. we have already used mata argument - depends_on and lifecycle.

# COUNT - resources are created as list.
using count meta argument, we can create n number of instances of given resource - 

```yml
resource "local_file" "pet" {               # pet is just a placeholder.
    filename = var.filename[count.index]
    count = length(var.filename)
}

variable "filename" {
    type = list(string)
    default = [
        "/root/pet.txt"
        "/root/dog.txt"
        "/root/man.txt
    ]
}
```
This way terraform will create files with provided name and also it means we can add on names and terraform will keep adding them.


# FOR_EACH - resources are created as MAP.
```yml
resource "local_sensitive_file" "name" {
    filename = each.value  # Set the filename for each file, taking values from the 'users' list
    for_each = toset(var.users) # Use 'for_each' with a set to iterate over unique user file paths  
    content = var.content # Set the content of each file (sensitive data like a password) 
}

variable "users" {
    type = list(string)    # Specify that this variable is a list of strings  
    default = [ "/root/user10", "/root/user11", "/root/user12", "/root/user13"] # Default list of file paths. 
}
variable "content" {
    default = "password: S3cr3tP@ssw0rd"
  
}

üìå for_each vs count ‚Äì Side-by-Side Comparison
Feature	                            for_each (‚úÖ Preferred)	                count (‚ö†Ô∏è Use with Caution)
Works with...	                      Lists, Sets, Maps ‚úÖ	                    Only Lists ‚ùå
Tracks Individual Resources?	      ‚úÖ Yes	                                  ‚ùå No (Uses index numbers)
Handles Changes Gracefully?	        ‚úÖ Yes (Only modifies what‚Äôs needed)	    ‚ùå No (Index shift can cause recreation)
Adding/Removing Items	              ‚úÖ Only affects the specific resource	  ‚ùå Can recreate all resources
Referencing Items	                  each.value or each.key	                 count.index
Example (File Creation)	            for_each = toset(var.files)	             count = length(var.files)
```

# version constraints - 
we can push terraform to install specific version of provider, to do this we select version and code block with that.
then we paste that block in main.tf on top - something similar based on version you need to paste in main.tf or versions.tf - 
```yml
terraform {
  required_version = "= 1.4.0"  # Ensure Terraform uses exactly version 1.4.0

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "= 1.3.5"  # Lock AWS provider to 1.3.5
    }
  }
}

or we can suggest the specific version which we dont want terraform to download - 
version = "!= 2.0.0"

or to make use of version lesser than specific one - 
version = "< 1.4.0"

or any version in this category - 
version = "~> 1.2"
greater than or equal to 1.2.
```
